            <h4>About Me</h4>
            <p>My name is Arman Jeevani. I am Indian by birth and brought up in Kampala, Uganda. I lived in Uganda for 14 Years until I moved to Canada for further education. My interest in technology developed at a young age, I used to go to my Dad's shop where he would tell me all about different electronics available. My Dad bought me my first computer shortly after I told him about my interest in technology. I used to explore all kinds of stuff on the internet like visiting differenet websites just to look at their designs, played lots of video games, downloaded differnet operating systems on virtiual machines and even tried developing some games and websites using online builders.</p>

            <h4 id="reflect">Reflection</h4>
            <p id="reflect">This course has been a great experience overall. Before I started thhis course, I had a little knowledge about web development but not so much that I could make a full functional website with all the different pages, use differnet css styles and also use javascript for the website. Some of the topics did require me to parctice them a couple times more and a few even had me asking other students in order to learn them well. Overall I had an amazing time learning and hope to do the same next semester. </p>
